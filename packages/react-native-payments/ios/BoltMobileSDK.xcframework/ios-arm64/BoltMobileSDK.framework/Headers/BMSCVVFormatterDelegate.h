/**
 A UITextFieldDelegate class that will auto format its text field with a masked CVV value.

 This class internally contains the CVV set in the text field. When text is changed, this value is updated and a masked
 value is set to the text field. The masking character can be changed using [BMSCVVFormatterDelegate maskCharacter].

 You can check if the CVV is valid using [BMSCVVFormatterDelegate isValidCVV],
 [BMSCVVFormatterDelegate isValidCVVForCardNumber:] or [BMSCVVFormatterDelegate isValidCVVWithCardFormatter:].

 To retrieve the CVV, use [BMSCVVFormatterDelegate setCVVOnCardInfo:] to set it onto your BMSCardInfo object.

 To clear the CVV and text field use [BMSTextFieldDelegateProxy clearTextField].
